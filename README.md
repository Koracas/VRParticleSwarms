# Particle Swarm in SteamVR

Originaly modifed from https://github.com/antoinefournier/XParticle.

This provided a particle system using compute shaders to handle the particle computation on the GPU.

This project will convert this to a SteamVR project and introduce flocking logic to the particles.
